Return the jacobian `drdx`, or approximations thereof

Return a preconditioner `K` for calculating the descent direction `p`,

    getsystemmatrix(problem,solver)

Return the system matrix of the problem. For a Newton solver this
method should return the Jacobian, while for a steepest descent method
this can be a preconditioner as e.g., the L2 product of the gradients.
By default the system matrix for the `SteepestDescent` method is the unity matrix
and thus, renders a vanilla gradient descent solver.

density over the domain Œ©.

    update_to_next_step!(problem, time)

Update prescribed values, external loads etc. for the given time
Called in the beginning of each new time step. 
Note: For adaptive time stepping, it may be called with a lower 
time than the previous time if the solution did not converge.

Assemble the residual and stiffness for `x+=Œîx`. 

- Some linear solvers may be inaccurate, and if modified stiffness is used 
  to enforce constraints on `x`, it is good the force `Œîx=0` on these
  components inside this function. 
- Note that the function must also support only one argument: `problem`,
  this version is called the first time after 
  `update-update_to_next_step!` and should default to `Œîx=0`
