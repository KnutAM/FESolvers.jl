Return the current residual vector of the problem
"""

"""
    getsystemmatrix(problem,solver)

Return the system matrix of the problem. For a Newton solver this
method should return the Jacobian, while for a steepest descent method
this can be a preconditioner as e.g., the L2 product of the gradients.
By default the system matrix for the `SteepestDescent` method is the unity matrix
and thus, renders a vanilla gradient descent solver.

    calculate_energy(problem,ùêÆ)

Return the energy of the system (a scalar) which is the integrated energy
density over the domain Œ©.

"""
    update_to_next_step!(problem, time)

Update prescribed values, external loads etc. for the given time
Called in the beginning of each new time step. 
Note: For adaptive time stepping, it may be called with a lower 
time than the previous time if the solution did not converge.

    update_problem!(problem, Œîx=0*getunknowns(problem))

Assemble the residual and stiffness for `x+=Œîx`. 

- Some linear solvers may be inaccurate, and if modified stiffness is used 
  to enforce constraints on `x`, it is good the force `Œîx=0` on these
  components inside this function. 
- Note that the function must also support only one argument: `problem`,
  this version is called the first time after 
  `update-update_to_next_step!` and should default to `Œîx=0`

    calculate_convergence_criterion(problem)

Calculate a value to be compared with the tolerance of the nonlinear solver. 
A standard case when using [Ferrite.jl](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Ferrite.jl)
is `norm(getresidual(problem)[Ferrite.free_dofs(dbcs)])`

Do necessary update operations once it is known that the

Only called directly after the problem has converged.

    postprocess!(problem, step)

Perform any postprocessing at the current time and step nr `step`
Called after time step converged, and after `handle_converged!`
