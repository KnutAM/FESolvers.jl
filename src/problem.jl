Return a preconditioner `K` for calculating the descent direction `p`,

Used by the `SteepestDescent` solver, and defaults to `I` if not defined.

    getsystemmatrix(problem,nlsolver)

Return the system matrix of the problem. For a Newton solver this
method should return the Jacobian, while for a steepest descent method
this can be a preconditioner as e.g., the L2 product of the gradients.
By default the system matrix for the `SteepestDescent` method is the unity matrix
and thus, renders a vanilla gradient descent solver.

    update_to_next_step!(problem, time)

Update prescribed values, external loads etc. for the given time.

This function is called in the beginning of each new time step. 
Note that for adaptive time stepping, it may be called with a lower 
time than the previous time if the solution did not converge.
"""

"""
    update_problem!(problem, Δx, update_spec::UpdateSpec)

Update the unknowns of the problem by `Δx` according to `update_spec`.
Note that 
- Some linear solvers may be inaccurate, and if a modified stiffness is used 
  to enforce constraints on `x`, it is good the force `Δx=0` on these
  components inside this function. 
- `Δx=nothing` in the first call after [`update_to_next_step!`](@ref)
  in which case, typically, no change of `x` should be made. Dirichlet
  boundary conditions are typically updated in `update_to_next_step!`.

The `update_spec` gives the information about what and how to update.
See the documentation for [`UpdateSpec`](@ref) for further details. 
This feature is used by some nonlinear solvers to customize the iteration 
strategy to speed up or aid convergence. For basic cases when getting started, 
this can be ignored and a simple function definition would be 
```julia
FESolvers.update_problem!(problem, Δx, _)
```


    update_problem!(problem, Δx; update_residual::Bool, update_jacobian::Bool)

The old but now deprecated interface is still available without `update_spec`.
The instructions are here:

* Assemble the residual if `update_residual=true`
* Assemble the jacobian if `update_jacobian=true`

is `norm(getresidual(problem)[Ferrite.free_dofs(ch)])`
